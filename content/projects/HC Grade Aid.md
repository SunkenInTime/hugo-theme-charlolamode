This app is a grade calculator that is designed specifically for students in the Howard County Public School System (HCPSS). It allows students to input their grades for each class and calculates their overall GPA (grade point average) as well as their final grade for the semester or year. The calculator takes into account the different weighting of classes, such as honors and AP classes, to ensure an accurate calculation of the student's GPA. It is a user-friendly tool that helps students stay on top of their grades and track their progress throughout the school year.
